# Project-Paula
My mother, Paula, suffers from chronic health problems and it requires that I check up on her multiple times throughout the day. Since she does not own a cell phone, I have decided to build a solution that allows her to reach me at the push of a button.


## Hardware & Software Needed
- Raspberry Pi
- IR (Infrared) Receiver Sensor (TSOP38238) from Adafruit Industries
- Mini Remote Control from Adafruit Industries
- Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing/us)


## Resources & References

I used this program to get the HEX codes from the IR receiver. See remote.py.

I used Final-From-Video.py from this repo to read any incoming button clicks. I simply added the email and sms functionality to that script. See script.py.
